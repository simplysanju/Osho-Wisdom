##Core Teachings of Osho

###**1️⃣ Meditation – The Path of Awareness**

>“Meditation is a simple process of watching your own mind. Not fighting with the mind. Not trying to control it either.”

Unlike traditional meditation methods that emphasize control, Osho’s approach is about **watching and witnessing the mind** without resistance. He introduced various meditation techniques such as:

✔️**Vipassana** – Silent witnessing of thoughts  
✔️**No-Mind Meditation** – Letting go of all mental chatter

###**2️⃣ Love & Freedom – The Two Wings of the Soul**

>“Love cannot be learned, it cannot be cultivated. It comes only when the mind is silent and the heart is singing.”

Osho spoke extensively on **love, relationships, and freedom**. He taught that:

-Love should be **free from attachment and expectations**.
-True love is **not possession** but a state of **being**.
-Freedom and love go hand in hand; **without freedom, love turns into slavery**.

###**3️⃣ Awareness & Conscious Living**

>“The moment you accept yourself, you become beautiful.”

Osho emphasized **living in the present moment with full awareness**. He taught:
